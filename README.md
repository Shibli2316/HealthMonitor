# HealthMonitor
<p>We live in a world where everything moves fast. And in this fast moving world we often forget to take care of ourselves, falling prey to never ending diseases like <em>increased level of blood suger level</em> and <em>high blood pressure</em></p>
<p>There are one of those cronic illness that has became a part of our life and we have learned to live with those pills around us. Apart from stress and actual depression that clunches the majority I aim to reach the roots that causes increased Blood suger level or shoots up someone's blood pressure.</p>
<p>I am aiming to make a BSL and BP monitoring system that will keep a record of your health issues relating to these topics and suggest you a diet accordingly. In addition to this I will include an analysis part to it, through which the patient will be able to analise what is causing the trouble, be it due to his meal or some other factors. I will also include a part where the patient can have his statistical data like the average in last 14 days or so. Further I will maintain and keep on updating it as per the requirements.</p>
<p>This is in its initial phase feel free to contribute and suggest improvements. I will be using the MERN stack for this project. Suggestions are always welcomed.</p>
Following is the path to completion: <br>
<li>Basic prototype to store BSL and BP.
<li>Updating the diet chart, based on your data.
<li>Analysing the food the patient consumed.
<li>Presenting visual analysis to the patient, stating the <em>possible</em> reason.
<li>Develop a mobile application for the same task
<h4>Note</h4>
I will be in need of some people to collect data, be it through a hospital or individual volunteer.
